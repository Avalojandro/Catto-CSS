Catto-CSS is divided into 4 types of animations with a simple syntax: **Hover**, **Automatic**, **Infinity** and **Scroll Animations.**

# How to use
## Hover, Automatic and Infinity animations
- Download Catto-CSS
- Include catto.css at the head of your file
- Make a class in the element that you want animate 
- Select and copy the class in the Animations Section of the Catto Website (Comming Soon)
- Paste the name of the animations in the element class

## Scroll animations
- Download Catto-CSS
- Include catto.css at the head of your file
- Include the JQuery CDN in the end of your file 
- Next, download the waypoints in http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/
- Include the jquery.waypoints.js under the JQuery CDN
- Then, include the scrollcat.js under the jquery.waypoints.js
- Select and copy the class in the Animations Section of the Catto Website (Comming Soon)
- Finally, paste the name of the animation in the element class

## Hover Animations (h-)
The animation is activated when the pointer is over the element 
### Example:
You have an element `<a>Click Here</a>` With the hover animation you can place the class `h-float` in your element, so then your code look like this: **`<a class="h-float">Click Here</a>`**

## Automatic Animations (a-)
The animation is automatically activated when the site reloads
>It is advisable to use automatic animations in the top of your website for a good functionality
### Example:
You have an element `<span>Hello World</span>` With the automatic animation you can place the class `a-blink` in your element, so then your code look like this: **`<span class="a-blink">Hello World</span>`**

## Infinity Animations (i-)
The animation is repeated an infinite amount of times
### Example:
You have an element `<h1>My Title</h1>` With the automatic animation you can place the class `i-bounce` in your element, so then your code look like this: **`<h1 class="i-bounce">My title</h1>`**

### Scroll Animations (s-o-)
The animation is activated through the browser scroll
### Example:
You have an element `<img src="./Images/picture.jpg">` With the automatic animation you can place the class `s-o-slideFadeLeft` in your element, so then your code look like this: **`<img class="s-o-slideFadeLeft" src="./Images/picture.jpg">`** <br><br>
