Catto-CSS is divided into 4 types of animations with a simple syntax: **Hover**, **Automatic**, **Infinity** and **Scroll Animations.**
## Hover Animations (h-)
The animation is activated when the pointer is over the element 
### Example:
You have an element `<a>Click Here</a>` With the hover animation you can place the class `h-float` in your element, so then your code look like this: **`<a class="h-float">Click Here</a>`**

## Automatic Animations (A-)
The animation is automatically activated when the site reloads
>It is advisable to use automatic animations in the top of your website for a good functionality
### Example:
You have an element `<span>Hello World</span>` With the automatic animation you can place the class `a-blink` in your element, so then your code look like this: **`<span class="a-blink">Hello World</span>`**

## Infinity Animations (I-)
The animation is repeated an infinite amount of times
### Example:
You have an element `<h1>My Title</h1>` With the automatic animation you can place the class `i-bounce` in your element, so then your code look like this: **`<h1 class="i-bounce">My title</h1>`**

### Scroll Animations (S-)
The animation is activated through the browser scroll
### Example:
You have an element `<img src="./Images/picture.jpg">` With the automatic animation you can place the class `s-o-slideFadeLeft` in your element, so then your code look like this: **`<img class="s-o-slideFadeLeft" src="./Images/picture.jpg">`**
